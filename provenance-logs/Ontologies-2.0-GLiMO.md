**You:**

I need some help thinking through Ontologies 2.0 as the evolution of ontologies in an age of large language models analogous to "Software 2.0" in an age of Neural Networks. One idea is something like GLiMO which stands for "Guided Language Model Ontology" and represents a set of principles and best practices for creating ontologies specifically designed to assist and guide large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in generating context-aware content. The main goal of GLiMO is to strike a balance between expressiveness and usability, ensuring that the ontology provides enough information for the LLM to understand the domain and its relationships without overwhelming it with excessive complexity.

GLiMO involves the use of standard vocabularies, such as schema.org types and properties, and SKOS annotations for definitions, notes, and examples. It adheres to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) to ensure the ontology is discoverable and accessible to both humans and machines. Additionally, GLiMO incorporates lightweight logical constructs from RDF Schema (RDFS) or Web Ontology Language (OWL) to provide logical cues that help LLMs better understand the structure and relationships within the domain.

The process of creating a GLiMO-based ontology is iterative, involving domain definition, competency question identification, and ontology generation. This approach helps ensure the ontology is efficient, maintainable, and effective in guiding LLMs to produce accurate and context-aware content.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ontologies 2.0 can be seen as a way to adapt traditional ontology engineering approaches to better suit the needs of large language models like ChatGPT. GLiMO, as you mentioned, is an excellent example of this. To further expand on this concept, we can consider the following aspects of Ontologies 2.0:

1.  Emphasis on context-awareness: Ontologies 2.0 should emphasize the importance of context in providing cues for LLMs. This can be done by incorporating context-dependent properties, rules, or examples in the ontology to enable LLMs to generate content that is sensitive to the current context.
    
2.  Dynamic and adaptable ontologies: One of the main challenges faced by ontology engineering is the rapidly changing nature of knowledge. To address this, Ontologies 2.0 should be designed with adaptability in mind, allowing for dynamic updates as new information becomes available. This could involve using machine learning techniques to automatically update the ontology based on real-world data or user feedback.
    
3.  Human-in-the-loop ontology engineering: Ontologies 2.0 should involve a human-in-the-loop approach, where domain experts and ontology engineers collaborate with LLMs during the ontology development process. This collaboration can help identify gaps in the ontology, address ambiguity, and ensure that the ontology accurately reflects domain knowledge.
    
4.  Scalability and modularity: To facilitate large-scale adoption and use, Ontologies 2.0 should be designed with scalability and modularity in mind. This can be achieved by breaking down complex domains into smaller, more manageable components, and by leveraging existing ontologies and knowledge bases whenever possible.
    
5.  Evaluation and validation: Establishing evaluation and validation mechanisms is essential for ensuring the quality and effectiveness of Ontologies 2.0. This may involve developing benchmarks or evaluation frameworks that assess the performance of LLMs when using the ontology, as well as incorporating user feedback to iteratively refine the ontology.
    
6.  Integration with other AI systems: Ontologies 2.0 should be designed with integration in mind, allowing for seamless interaction with other AI systems and components. This could involve developing APIs, protocols, or data models that enable easy integration with other AI systems, such as computer vision models, recommendation engines, or decision support systems.
    

In summary, Ontologies 2.0 aims to adapt traditional ontology engineering practices to better suit the needs of large language models. This can be achieved by developing context-aware, dynamic, and adaptable ontologies, involving humans in the loop, ensuring scalability and modularity, and establishing evaluation and validation mechanisms. By following these principles, Ontologies 2.0 can play a crucial role in guiding LLMs to produce accurate and context-aware content.

**You:**

This is really good. I also want to consider the role of Ontologies 2.0 in cognitive architectures for LLM based autonomous agents, semantic structure for memory systems based on embeddings and vector databases like weaviate. What role do "Knowledge Graphs 2.0" play in this cognitive architecture. 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Ontologies 2.0 and Knowledge Graphs 2.0 can play significant roles in the cognitive architecture of LLM-based autonomous agents by providing structured knowledge and semantic support for memory systems based on embeddings and vector databases like Weaviate.

1.  Semantic grounding: Ontologies 2.0 can help LLM-based agents ground their knowledge and reasoning in a structured and semantically rich format.

**You:**

Ok. Let's reimagine ontologies given this context. What parts of the semantic web and linked data stack make sense?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Reimagining ontologies in the context of LLM-based agents and the evolving needs of AI systems requires a careful examination of the semantic web and linked data stack. Some components of the stack that make sense in this context include:

1.  RDF (Resource Description Framework): RDF remains a fundamental building block for representing structured knowledge, as it provides a simple and flexible model to describe entities, attributes, and relationships. In the context of LLM-based agents, RDF can be used to represent knowledge extracted from natural language text or other sources and to facilitate interoperability among different AI components.
    
2.  RDFS (RDF Schema) and OWL (Web Ontology Language): RDFS and OWL provide the means to define vocabularies, classes, and relationships for ontologies. These languages allow for more complex and expressive knowledge representation, including class hierarchies, property constraints, and logical reasoning. While LLM-based agents may not fully exploit the logical expressiveness of these languages, using lightweight constructs from RDFS and OWL can still provide valuable cues for better understanding the domain and its relationships.
    
3.  SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System): SKOS is a useful vocabulary for representing thesauri, classification schemes, and taxonomies in a simple, standardized format. It can be used in combination with other ontologies to provide definitions, notes, and examples for concepts, as well as to manage hierarchical and associative relationships between them. This can help LLM-based agents better understand and organize their knowledge.
    
4.  SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language): SPARQL is a powerful query language for RDF data, allowing for complex querying and data manipulation. In the context of LLM-based agents, SPARQL can be used to access and retrieve information from knowledge graphs or ontologies, facilitating data-driven decision-making and reasoning.
    
5.  Linked Data principles: The core principles of Linked Data—using URIs to identify resources, using HTTP URIs to enable resource lookup, providing useful information about resources using RDF, and including links to related resources—can still be applied in the context of LLM-based agents. These principles promote interoperability, data integration, and reusability, which are essential for building scalable and flexible AI systems.
    
6.  FAIR data principles: The FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) ensure that ontologies and knowledge graphs are discoverable and accessible by both humans and machines. Adhering to these principles can help LLM-based agents efficiently locate, access, and utilize knowledge resources.
    

By carefully selecting and adapting components from the semantic web and linked data stack, we can create a more suitable and flexible knowledge representation framework for LLM-based agents. This can help these agents better understand their environment, reason about complex domains, and interact more effectively with users and other AI systems.

* * *

**You:**

Ok. Think critically. Do these components make sense in an age of RLHF and prompt engineering?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In an age of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and prompt engineering, the role of traditional semantic web and linked data components may need to be reevaluated. While some components still provide value, others may not be as relevant or require adaptation to better align with the needs of modern AI systems. Here are some critical reflections on these components in the context of RLHF and prompt engineering:

1.  RDF: While RDF is a flexible model for representing structured knowledge, modern AI systems like LLMs can potentially learn to work with more intuitive or compact knowledge representations. However, RDF can still be useful for interoperability, especially when integrating data from different sources or collaborating with other AI components.
    
2.  RDFS and OWL: The full expressiveness of RDFS and OWL may not be necessary for LLM-based agents, as they can learn a significant amount of domain knowledge and relationships implicitly through their training data. However, lightweight constructs from these languages can still provide valuable cues for understanding the domain and its relationships, especially when human feedback is limited.
    
3.  SKOS: SKOS remains relevant as it provides a simple and standardized way to represent and manage thesauri, classification schemes, and taxonomies. This can help LLM-based agents better understand and organize their knowledge, especially when dealing with complex or hierarchical concepts.
    
4.  SPARQL: In the context of RLHF and prompt engineering, the need for a dedicated query language like SPARQL may be less critical. LLMs can potentially be trained to answer questions or retrieve information without relying on explicit queries. However, SPARQL can still be useful for data manipulation, integration, and retrieval when working with RDF data, especially in hybrid AI systems that combine LLMs with traditional knowledge representation techniques.
    
5.  Linked Data principles: While some Linked Data principles may not be as crucial for LLM-based agents (e.g., using HTTP URIs for resource lookup), others remain relevant, such as using URIs for resource identification and including links to related resources. These principles can contribute to better interoperability, data integration, and reusability.
    
6.  FAIR data principles: The FAIR data principles remain important for ensuring discoverability and accessibility of knowledge resources, even in the context of RLHF and prompt engineering. Adhering to these principles can help LLM-based agents efficiently locate, access, and utilize knowledge resources, regardless of the specific knowledge representation format or learning paradigm.
    

In conclusion, while some components of the semantic web and linked data stack may need to be reevaluated or adapted in the age of RLHF and prompt engineering, many still provide value for LLM-based agents. By selectively incorporating these components, we can create a knowledge representation framework that supports modern AI systems while leveraging the benefits of traditional semantic web technologies.

* * *

**You:**

Ok. I agree with your critical analysis. How would technologies like pinecone or weaviate fit in with this evolving stack?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Technologies like Pinecone and Weaviate can be integrated with the evolving semantic web and linked data stack to enhance the capabilities of LLM-based agents and other AI systems. These technologies primarily focus on vector-based data storage and retrieval, offering a powerful and scalable approach to managing large volumes of data. They can fit into the evolving stack in the following ways:

1.  Hybrid knowledge representation: Pinecone and Weaviate can be used alongside traditional RDF-based knowledge graphs to create a hybrid knowledge representation system. This can enable LLM-based agents to work with both structured semantic data and vector-based data, providing a more comprehensive and flexible approach to knowledge management.
    
2.  Semantic embeddings: Vector-based data storage and retrieval systems like Pinecone and Weaviate can be employed to store and manage semantic embeddings generated from LLMs or other neural networks. These embeddings can capture the semantic relationships between entities and concepts, allowing for more efficient and effective retrieval of relevant information. By integrating these embeddings with traditional semantic web technologies, we can enhance the overall knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of AI systems.
    
3.  Context-aware information retrieval: By incorporating vector-based data storage and retrieval systems into the evolving semantic web and linked data stack, we can enable more advanced and context-aware information retrieval for LLM-based agents. These systems can leverage the power of embeddings to retrieve information that is semantically relevant to the agent's current context or query, leading to more accurate and useful responses.
    
4.  Scalability and performance: Pinecone and Weaviate can help address the scalability and performance challenges faced by traditional semantic web technologies, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. These vector-based systems can store and retrieve data more efficiently, allowing LLM-based agents to access and process knowledge more quickly.
    
5.  Integration with machine learning models: Pinecone and Weaviate can serve as a bridge between traditional semantic web technologies and modern machine learning models, facilitating seamless integration and collaboration between different AI components. By storing and managing both structured semantic data and vector-based embeddings, these technologies can enable LLM-based agents and other AI systems to effectively leverage the strengths of both approaches.
    

In summary, technologies like Pinecone and Weaviate can play a crucial role in the evolving semantic web and linked data stack by enabling hybrid knowledge representation, managing semantic embeddings, supporting context-aware information retrieval, improving scalability and performance, and integrating with machine learning models. By incorporating these technologies, we can create a more powerful and flexible knowledge representation framework that supports the needs of modern LLM-based agents and other AI systems.

**You:**

Ok. Let's focus on Ontologies 2.0. I think JSON-LD is still a useful representation for Large Language models since they have a good understanding of JSON and vocabularies like schema.org since schema.org vocabularies are represented in training sets. Is this a good assumption?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, your assumption is valid. JSON-LD is indeed a useful representation for Large Language Models, as it combines the simplicity and familiarity of JSON with the expressiveness of Linked Data. LLMs like ChatGPT have a good understanding of JSON due to their extensive exposure to JSON data during training. Additionally, JSON-LD allows for the use of standard vocabularies like schema.org, which are also well-represented in LLM training sets.

Using JSON-LD as a format for Ontologies 2.0 provides several advantages:

1.  Accessibility: JSON-LD is more accessible and easier to work with for developers and AI systems compared to other RDF serialization formats like Turtle or RDF/XML.
    
2.  Compatibility: JSON-LD is natively supported by many web APIs and data exchange systems, which can facilitate seamless integration and interoperability between AI components and external data sources.
    
3.  Readability: JSON-LD maintains the human-readable nature of JSON, making it easier for developers to understand and debug the ontology.
    
4.  Flexibility: JSON-LD can be easily extended or adapted to incorporate additional vocabularies, contexts, or custom data structures, making it a versatile choice for Ontologies 2.0.
    
5.  Standard vocabularies: JSON-LD supports the use of standard vocabularies like schema.org, which helps LLMs better understand the domain and its relationships. Schema.org vocabularies are widely used and represented in the training data of LLMs, making them a suitable choice for guiding large language models.
    

In summary, using JSON-LD as a representation for Ontologies 2.0 is a good choice, as it leverages the familiarity and understanding of JSON by LLMs while incorporating the benefits of Linked Data and standard vocabularies like schema.org. This can lead to more efficient and effective AI systems that can better understand their environment and generate context-aware content.

* * *

**You:**

Could you give me an example of how, as a large language model, might represent ontologies 2.0 in JSON-LD?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Let's consider an example from the domain of books and authors. In this Ontologies 2.0 example, we'll use JSON-LD to represent entities and relationships between books, authors, and publishers using schema.org vocabularies. Here's a simple JSON-LD representation:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/"
  },
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "urn:book:1",
      "@type": "Book",
      "name": "The Catcher in the Rye",
      "author": {
        "@id": "urn:author:1"
      },
      "publisher": {
        "@id": "urn:publisher:1"
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "urn:author:1",
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "J.D. Salinger"
    },
    {
      "@id": "urn:publisher:1",
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "Little, Brown and Company"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, we define a simple ontology using the schema.org vocabulary. We represent a book, "The Catcher in the Rye", its author, "J.D. Salinger", and the publisher, "Little, Brown and Company". The JSON-LD structure includes:

*   `@context`: Defines the context for the JSON-LD document. In this case, we're using schema.org as the default vocabulary.
*   `@graph`: Contains an array of objects representing the entities and relationships in the ontology.
*   `@id`: Provides a unique identifier (URI) for each entity.
*   `@type`: Specifies the type of each entity, using schema.org classes like "Book", "Person", and "Organization".

As a large language model, I can parse and understand this JSON-LD representation, identifying entities and their relationships based on the schema.org vocabulary. This allows me to better understand the domain and generate more accurate and context-aware content related to books, authors, and publishers.

* * *

**You:**

Ok. You're thinking like Ontologies 1.0 and giving an example relative that is a common one for Ontologies 1.0. Let's think critically toward ontologies 2.0 as a large language model and prompt engineering.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

I apologize for the confusion. Let's consider a more focused example for Ontologies 2.0, taking into account the unique capabilities of large language models and prompt engineering.

In Ontologies 2.0, we can focus on providing lightweight guidance to LLMs like ChatGPT by incorporating high-level concepts, relationships, and examples that facilitate prompt engineering. Instead of defining every detail, we can provide a more general structure that helps LLMs understand the context and domain.

Here's a JSON-LD example representing a simplified Ontologies 2.0 structure for the domain of movies and actors:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/"
  },
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@type": "Movie",
      "guidance": {
        "questions": [
          "What is the title of the movie?",
          "When was the movie released?",
          "Who directed the movie?",
          "What is the genre of the movie?"
        ],
        "examples": [
          "The movie {title} was released in {year}, directed by {director}, and belongs to the {genre} genre."
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Person",
      "guidance": {
        "questions": [
          "What is the name of the actor?",
          "What is the actor's date of birth?",
          "What are some movies the actor has starred in?"
        ],
        "examples": [
          "{actorName} was born on {birthDate} and has starred in movies such as {movieList}."
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "schema:actor",
      "guidance": {
        "questions": [
          "Who are the main actors in the movie?"
        ],
        "examples": [
          "The main actors in the movie {title} are {actors}."
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, we represent high-level concepts related to movies and actors, along with guidance for prompt engineering in the form of competency questions and examples. This information can help ChatGPT generate more accurate and context-aware content related to movies and actors.

The JSON-LD structure includes:

*   `@context`: Defines the context for the JSON-LD document, using schema.org as the default vocabulary.
*   `@graph`: Contains an array of objects representing the high-level concepts and guidance in the ontology.
*   `@type`: Specifies the type of each entity, using schema.org classes like "Movie" and "Person".
*   `guidance`: A custom property containing an object with competency questions and examples that can assist LLMs in prompt engineering.

The focus of this Ontologies 2.0 example is to provide lightweight guidance to LLMs rather than a comprehensive and detailed representation of the domain. This approach is more in line with the unique capabilities of large language models and can help improve their understanding of specific domains and contexts.

* * *

**You:**

Yes! This is progress! Lets incorporate a few things from Ontologies 1.0 like class hierarchies. We still want to construct knowledge graph structures, so think property relations are still important.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! We can incorporate class hierarchies and property relations from Ontologies 1.0 while still focusing on lightweight guidance for LLMs. Let's extend the previous movies and actors example with additional class hierarchy and property relations:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/"
  },
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@id": "urn:Category:1",
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "guidance": {
        "questions": [
          "What is the name of the creative work?",
          "What is the author or creator of the creative work?"
        ],
        "examples": [
          "{workName} is a creative work by {creator}."
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "urn:Category:2",
      "@type": "Movie",
      "subClassOf": "urn:Category:1",
      "guidance": {
        "questions": [
          "What is the title of the movie?",
          "When was the movie released?",
          "Who directed the movie?",
          "What is the genre of the movie?"
        ],
        "examples": [
          "The movie {title} was released in {year}, directed by {director}, and belongs to the {genre} genre."
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Person",
      "guidance": {
        "questions": [
          "What is the name of the person?",
          "What is the person's date of birth?",
          "What are some works the person has been involved in?"
        ],
        "examples": [
          "{personName} was born on {birthDate} and has been involved in works such as {workList}."
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "schema:actor",
      "subPropertyOf": "schema:contributor",
      "guidance": {
        "questions": [
          "Who are the main actors in the movie?"
        ],
        "examples": [
          "The main actors in the movie {title} are {actors}."
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, we've introduced the following changes:

1.  Class hierarchy: We've added a superclass "CreativeWork" and made "Movie" a subclass of "CreativeWork". This allows us to represent a more general class of creative works and demonstrate the hierarchy between different classes.
    
2.  Property relations: We've introduced the "subPropertyOf" relationship for the "schema:actor" property, indicating that it is a more specific property related to "schema:contributor". This helps in expressing the relationship between different properties.
    

By incorporating class hierarchies and property relations from Ontologies 1.0 while maintaining the focus on lightweight guidance, we can create a more expressive and flexible Ontologies 2.0 representation. This approach can help LLMs like ChatGPT better understand the domain, context, and relationships between entities while facilitating prompt engineering.

**You:**

Ok. What extensions do we need to schema.org and skos in order to support context for LLMs? 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To better support context for Large Language Models (LLMs) within schema.org and SKOS, we can consider extending these vocabularies with additional properties and classes that specifically cater to LLM needs. These extensions would aim to provide context, guidance, and examples that help LLMs generate more accurate and context-aware content.

Here are some suggested extensions:

1.  Guidance: Introduce a new "guidance" property that can be used with both schema.org and SKOS classes. This property can contain an object with two arrays: "questions" and "examples". The "questions" array would contain competency questions related to the class or property, while the "examples" array would provide example sentences or templates that demonstrate how to use the class or property in context.
    
2.  Contextual cues: Extend schema.org and SKOS with properties that provide more information about the context in which an entity appears. This could include properties such as "relatedConcepts", "relevantDomains", or "useCases" that help LLMs understand the context and relationships between entities.
    
3.  Synonyms and alternative labels: Enhance SKOS with additional properties for alternative labels and synonyms that are more specific to the LLM domain. For example, "llmLabel" and "llmAltLabel" could be added to provide alternative names for concepts that are more familiar or commonly used by LLMs.
    
4.  Confidence scores: Introduce a new property "confidenceScore" that can be associated with schema.org or SKOS classes and properties. This score, ranging from 0 to 1, would indicate the level of confidence an LLM should have when using the class or property, helping to fine-tune the LLM's output.
    
5.  Provenance and source information: Extend schema.org and SKOS with properties that capture the provenance and source of the information, such as "dataSource", "lastUpdated", or "curatedBy". This additional metadata can help LLMs assess the reliability and relevance of the ontology data.
    

By extending schema.org and SKOS with these additional properties and classes, we can provide better context and guidance for LLMs like ChatGPT, enabling them to generate more accurate, context-aware, and reliable content based on the ontologies.

**You:**

Ok. I want to also leverage Prov-o for provenance information. What is the difference between llmlabel and skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Prov-o is an excellent choice for representing provenance information, as it's a widely accepted vocabulary for expressing provenance on the Semantic Web.

Regarding the difference between "llmLabel", "skos:prefLabel", and "skos:altLabel":

1.  skos:prefLabel: This property is part of the SKOS vocabulary and represents the preferred human-readable label for a concept. In a given language, there should be only one preferred label per concept. For example, for a concept representing the United States, the skos:prefLabel might be "United States".
    
2.  skos:altLabel: Also part of the SKOS vocabulary, "skos:altLabel" is used to represent alternative human-readable labels for a concept. These are labels that are not preferred but still valid and useful. For example, an alternative label for the United States could be "USA" or "U.S."
    
3.  llmLabel: This is a hypothetical property we suggested earlier in the context of extending SKOS to better support LLMs. The purpose of "llmLabel" would be to provide labels specifically tailored for use by large language models. These labels might be more familiar or commonly used by LLMs in their training data, or they might be better suited for natural language processing tasks. The main difference between "llmLabel" and the SKOS labels is the intended audience: while "skos:prefLabel" and "skos:altLabel" are designed primarily for human consumption, "llmLabel" would be specifically designed for LLMs.
    

To summarize, "skos:prefLabel" and "skos:altLabel" are part of the SKOS vocabulary and provide human-readable labels for concepts, while "llmLabel" is a suggested extension that would provide labels specifically tailored for large language models.

* * *

**You:**

Could you give me an example of a llmLabel?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Let's consider a scenario where a concept represents a machine learning technique called "Support Vector Machine" (SVM). In this case, the SKOS labels might look like this:

*   skos:prefLabel: "Support Vector Machine"
*   skos:altLabel: "SVM"

Now, let's assume that a common way of referring to this concept in the large language model's training data is "support vector classifier" (SVC). Although this term is not the preferred or alternative label in the SKOS vocabulary, it is still relevant and familiar to the LLM. In this case, the "llmLabel" would look like this:

*   llmLabel: "support vector classifier"

The "llmLabel" property provides an additional label tailored specifically for LLMs, ensuring they can recognize and work with familiar terminology from their training data while still leveraging the structured information from the SKOS vocabulary.

**You:**

Ok. As a LLM, critically evaluate and interpret this prompt. Is it sufficient to accomplish what I want to accomplish in terms of modeling?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

As an LLM, I interpret the prompt as a request to create a new schema.org level vocabulary that extends the existing schema.org and SKOS vocabularies to better support Guided Language Model Ontology modeling. The focus is on lightweight guidance, high-level concepts, relationships, and examples suitable for prompt engineering. The prompt also emphasizes the inclusion of context, guidance, examples, and suggested properties such as llmLabel and confidence scores.

The prompt is clear and provides a good starting point for accomplishing your goal. However, to ensure a comprehensive approach to the modeling task, you may want to consider adding a few more details:

1.  Specify the domain or domains you are particularly interested in. This will help narrow down the scope of the vocabulary and make the modeling process more targeted.
    
2.  Consider providing examples of existing schema.org or SKOS classes, properties, or relationships that you'd like to extend or enhance with the new vocabulary.
    
3.  Mention any additional requirements or constraints that the new vocabulary should adhere to, such as compatibility with certain tools, technologies, or standards.
    

By including these additional details, the prompt will be more robust and help ensure a more comprehensive approach to the modeling task.
